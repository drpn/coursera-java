 * Overriding allows a subclass to provide its own implementation of a method inherited from the superclass.
 * override only works when we have inheritance in the picture
 * since override means 2 methods having same signature - which cannot work in the same class
 * it works in child-parent structure
 * Overloading allows multiple methods with the same name but different parameters in a class.
