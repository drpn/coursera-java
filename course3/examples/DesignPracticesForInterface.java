The rule of thumb is to use interfaces where a consistent set of methods is required and abstract classes for internal reuse.

Client code should be written to interfaces, and references should always be declared to an interface.

LIMITATIONS:

If a new method is added to an interface, every class that implements that interface must provide an implementation for the new method. Java 8 solved it by using default methods.
