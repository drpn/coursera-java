Abstract classes act like interfaces in that they specify required methods.

However, unlike interfaces, abstract classes are actual classes and can provide data support and method implementations.

Abstract classes are restricted to single inheritance, while interfaces can be implemented by multiple classes.

Interfaces vs. Abstract Classes:

Interfaces can only have final attributes and abstract methods.
Java 8 introduced default methods and static methods in interfaces.

Classes can implement multiple interfaces, unlike abstract classes which can only inherit from one parent class.

Interfaces can inherit from other interfaces but cannot inherit from classes.

This flexibility allows for polymorphism in Java, enabling different classes to implement the same interface.

Java 8 introduced "default" methods in interfaces, which can be optionally implemented by classes.

Static methods can also be declared in interfaces, but they are limited to other static members.
