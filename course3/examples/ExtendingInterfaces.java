Interfaces in Java can extend other interfaces using the "extends" keyword.
Classes can implement interfaces using the "implements" keyword.
When a class implements an interface, it must implement all the methods defined in that interface.
Multiple inheritance is allowed in interfaces, meaning an interface can extend multiple interfaces.
