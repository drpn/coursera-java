class OuterClass {

    class NestedClass {

OR:

class OuterClass {
    ...
    class InnerClass {
        ...
    }
    static class StaticNestedClass {
        ...
    }
}

Non-static nested classes (inner classes) have access to other members of the enclosing class, even if they are declared private. 
Static nested classes do not have access to other members of the enclosing class.
