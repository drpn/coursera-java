/*
 * Why generics? - "abstraction over types"
 * 
 * 1. Generics allow us to write generic code without losing type safety.
 * 2. They can be used to write generic type declarations while creating classes, interfaces and methods;
 * that can work with different type of data types.
 * 3. compile-time type checking, to avoid runtime typecasting exceptions
 *
